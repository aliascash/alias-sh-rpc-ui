# Define global variables for text output
#
# 1. Yaml syntax because translations are generated with https://transifex.com/
# 2. Comments must start with "#" as the first character on the line
# 3. Interpret embedded "@Z" sequences in the dialog text by the following character,
#    which tells dialog to set colors or video attributes: 0 through 7 are the ANSI
#    used in curses: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan and white respectively.
#    Bold is set by 'b', reset by 'B'.
#    Reverse is set by 'r', reset by 'R'.
#    Underline is set by 'u', reset by 'U'.
#    The settings are cumulative,
#    e.g., "@Zb@Z1" makes the following text bold (perhaps bright) red.
#    Restore normal settings with "@Zn".
